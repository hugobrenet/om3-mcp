# Configuration

[Back to README](../README.md)

## Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| OPENSVC_MCP_LISTEN_ADDR | 127.0.0.1:8443 | HTTPS bind address, IPv4:port or [IPv6]:port |
| OPENSVC_MCP_TLS_CERT_FILE | empty | Absolute server certificate PEM path; enables the HTTPS listener |
| OPENSVC_MCP_TLS_KEY_FILE | empty | Absolute server private key PEM path; required with the certificate |
| OPENSVC_MCP_OAUTH_RESOURCE_URL | empty | Public HTTPS MCP URL ending in `/mcp`; expected access-token audience; required with HTTPS |
| OPENSVC_MCP_OAUTH_RESOURCE_NAME | OpenSVC Daemon MCP | Human-readable `resource_name` in public OAuth metadata |
| OPENSVC_MCP_OAUTH_ISSUER | empty | Exact trusted issuer for incoming MCP access JWTs; required with HTTPS |
| OPENSVC_MCP_OAUTH_CA_FILE | empty | Optional absolute PEM trust bundle for SSO HTTPS; replaces system roots |
| OPENSVC_MCP_AUTH_CONFIG_FILE | empty | Version 1 confidential SSO profile file; required when a cluster sets `auth` |
| OPENSVC_MCP_CLUSTER_CONFIG_FILE | empty | Cluster catalogue; required for the Unix socket and for exchanged daemon calls |
| OPENSVC_MCP_DELEGATED_SOCKET | empty | Absolute Unix socket path, at most 103 bytes; enables the delegated listener |

The MCP has two optional listeners; configure at least one:

- **HTTPS** for external agents, enabled by the certificate and key. It always
  requires OAuth. Daemon calls use RFC 8693 token exchange for the clusters
  configured with `auth`. Without exchange, incoming OAuth and tool discovery
  work, but daemon calls remain blocked. `OPENSVC_MCP_LISTEN_ADDR`, the OAuth
  variables and `OPENSVC_MCP_AUTH_CONFIG_FILE` are refused without HTTPS.
- **Unix socket** for OpenSVC components such as the AI agent, enabled by
  `OPENSVC_MCP_DELEGATED_SOCKET`. It requires the catalogue and no SSO.

See [authentication](authentication.md) and [token delegation](delegation.md)
for the complete contracts.

## HTTPS

Install the listener certificate/key and any SSO TLS CA bundle before starting.
JWT verification uses the SSO public JWKS; no JWT signing private key is needed:

```bash
OPENSVC_MCP_LISTEN_ADDR=0.0.0.0:8443 \
OPENSVC_MCP_TLS_CERT_FILE=/etc/opensvc-mcp/tls/server.crt \
OPENSVC_MCP_TLS_KEY_FILE=/etc/opensvc-mcp/tls/server.key \
OPENSVC_MCP_OAUTH_RESOURCE_URL=https://mcp.example.com:8443/mcp \
OPENSVC_MCP_OAUTH_ISSUER=https://sso.example.com/oauth/opensvc-mcp/ \
OPENSVC_MCP_CLUSTER_CONFIG_FILE=/etc/opensvc-mcp/clusters.yaml \
OPENSVC_MCP_AUTH_CONFIG_FILE=/etc/opensvc-mcp/auth.yaml \
  ./bin/om3-mcp
```

Values are illustrative: use the actual issuer of MCP access tokens, which does
not select a daemon. The process reads its environment only and loads no
environment file itself. Omit both `OPENSVC_MCP_CLUSTER_CONFIG_FILE` and
`OPENSVC_MCP_AUTH_CONFIG_FILE` for discovery-only operation, which needs no
client secret. Optional variables are listed in the table above.

The agent connects to `https://<mcp-host>:8443/mcp`. The bind address must
contain an explicit IP and a numeric port from 1 to 65535. Use `0.0.0.0` or
`[::]` only when intentionally listening on all interfaces. The certificate
must cover the agent-facing hostname or IP; its CA must be trusted by the agent.
Include intermediate certificates in the listener certificate PEM as needed.

TLS 1.2 or later is mandatory. Configuration, public trust files and listener
TLS material are validated before binding; startup never contacts a daemon.
Settings and files are snapshotted once. Restart to apply changes.
HTTP headers are bounded to 64 KiB, authenticated MCP request bodies to 1 MiB,
and header reads to 5 seconds. Shutdown drains requests for up to 30 seconds.

## Health check

`GET /health` on the same HTTPS listener returns HTTP 200 with
`{"status":"ok"}`, `Content-Type: application/json` and `Cache-Control: no-store`.
`HEAD /health` also returns HTTP 200, without a body. Other methods return 405.
No bearer token or target headers are required. The route reports local server
liveness only: it does not contact daemons or establish user authentication,
tool permissions or cluster health. An unavailable daemon does not affect it.

For a service check, use the hostname covered by the listener certificate:

```bash
curl --silent --show-error --fail --max-time 3 \
  https://mcp.example.com:8443/health >/dev/null
```

Use `--cacert /path/to/public-ca.pem` when the MCP listener uses a private CA.

## Cluster catalogue and exchange profiles

Use [clusters.yaml](../deploy/examples/clusters.yaml) and, for external agents,
[auth.yaml](../deploy/examples/auth.yaml). Install real configuration outside
the repository, for example at `/etc/opensvc-mcp/clusters.yaml`.

```yaml
clusters:
  cluster-a:
    name: cluster-a
    cluster_id: 00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000001
    endpoint: https://cluster-a-vip.example.com:1215
    auth:
      profile: customer-sso
      audience: opensvc-cluster-a
    tls:
      ca_file: /etc/opensvc-mcp/trust/cluster-a-tls-ca.pem
    request_timeout: 20s
```

- `clusters`: stable administrative references; these are not identities.
- `name`: human-readable name; it need not be unique.
- `cluster_id`: exact OpenSVC cluster ID; unique. It is the `cluster_id` tool
  argument on HTTPS and the `X-OpenSVC-Cluster-ID` header on the socket.
- `endpoint`: HTTPS origin of the cluster VIP, without credentials, path,
  query or fragment. No node inventory is required.
- `auth`: optional. `profile` names an entry of the profile file and
  `audience` the daemon token audience requested by token exchange. A cluster
  without `auth` is reachable only through the Unix socket, and is not listed
  to external agents.
- `tls.ca_file`: optional absolute public CA bundle path for daemon TLS.
  Omit `tls` for the system CA roots, for example with Let's Encrypt.
  An explicit bundle replaces, rather than extends, system roots.
- `tls.insecure`: optional boolean, default `false`; see below. It cannot be
  combined with `tls.ca_file`.
- `request_timeout`: required duration between `1s` and `2m`.

The profile file contains confidential client configuration and a secret-file
reference, never the secret itself. It accepts 1–64 profiles, HTTPS discovery
issuers, a confidential `client_id`, absolute `client_secret_file`,
`client_secret_basic` (default) or `client_secret_post`, up to 32 technical
scopes, a `request_timeout` from 1 second to 1 minute (default 10 seconds), and
optional `tls.ca_file`. SSO TLS verification cannot be disabled. Secret files
must be regular, at most 16 KiB, mode 0600 or 0400, and contain one nonempty
line. Unknown profile references prevent startup. Public discovery is lazy and
cached for five minutes.

The daemon verifies JWT signatures itself. Neither JWT public keys nor daemon
private signing keys belong on the MCP host. The optional TLS CA bundle
validates only the daemon HTTPS certificate chain. With TLS verification
enabled, an IP endpoint works if its certificate covers that IP; a DNS-only
certificate requires an endpoint using that DNS name. Administrators must
ensure each endpoint belongs to the declared cluster. Adding a catalogue entry
does not register or modify a daemon.

See [the deployment guide](token-exchange.md) for SSO setup and daemon
configuration.

### Demo-only TLS bypass

For a demo with an untrusted certificate or a hostname/IP mismatch, set this
inside the target cluster entry, without `ca_file`:

```yaml
tls:
  insecure: true
```

**Strongly discouraged in production.** The connection remains encrypted, but
the daemon is no longer authenticated: an intermediary could steal the JWT,
forge daemon responses and impersonate a user through `whoami`. The MCP logs a
startup warning for each affected cluster. The default is `false`.

This applies to MCP-to-daemon requests, including `whoami`, only. It does not
change listener TLS, HTTPS-only endpoints, origin binding or JWT checks.

### Validation and bounds

The strict loader rejects unknown fields, duplicate keys, multiple documents,
invalid scalar types, duplicate cluster IDs and empty catalogues. Equivalent HTTPS origins are normalized. Cluster
references contain 1–64 ASCII letters, digits, hyphens or underscores. Names
contain 1–128 bytes, IDs and audiences 1–256 bytes, without surrounding
whitespace or control characters.

Limits are 4 MiB of YAML and 4096 clusters. Trust files must be readable regular
files of at most 1 MiB. TLS bundles accept only valid public CA certificates,
not leaf certificates. All files are loaded at startup; restart to apply
changes, which do not alter the running snapshot.

## Runtime account

Run `om3-mcp` under a dedicated unprivileged account, for example
`opensvc-mcp:opensvc-mcp`. It must be able to read the listener certificate/key,
catalogue, confidential secret file and public trust files. Restrict private-key access to that account
and use an unprivileged port such as `8443`. For the Unix socket, see the
directory and group setup in [token delegation](delegation.md#socket-access).

An OpenSVC `app.simple` resource can manage the process with the environment
variables above. The binary does not load an environment file itself and does
not require systemd, a local OpenSVC daemon, its binary, user objects or private
signing keys.
